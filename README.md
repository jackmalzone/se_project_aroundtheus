## Responsive Design

`This project is fully responsive, designed to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices. By utilizing media queries, flexible grid layouts, and adaptive units such as percentages and viewport units, the layout adapts to screen sizes as small as mobile phones to as large as desktop monitors.`

Key responsiveness features include:

- **Media Queries:** CSS media queries are used to apply different styling rules based on the viewport size.
- **Flexible Images and Grids:** All images and grid-based layouts scale and resize to maintain their aspect ratio and fit within their respective containers.
- **Adaptive Units:** The use of `rem`, `vw`, and `vh` units, along with percentage-based widths, ensures that padding, margins, and element sizes adjust to the screen.
